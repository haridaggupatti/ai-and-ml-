  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "Here is how the file `/services/tradingOrchestrator.js/` looks like right now:\n```\n\n```\n\nAnd here is the\
    \ new implementation for the same file:\n```\nconst axios = require('axios');\nconst TradeController = require('../controllers/tradeController');\n\
    const tradingService = require('../services/tradingService');\nconst riskManagementService = require('../services/riskManagementService');\n\
    const grafService = require('../services/grafService');\nclass TradingOrchestrator {\n  constructor() {\n    this.tradeController\
    \ = new TradeController();\n  }\n\n  async startDemoTrading(user) {\n    try {\n      const marketData = await tradingService.fetchDemoMarketData();\n\
    \      // TODO: Get user's strategy and apply user feedback\n\n      const riskParameters = await riskManagementService.calculateRiskParameters(marketData);\n\
    \      const decision = await this.tradeController.executeTrade(riskParameters);\n      await grafService.updateGraf(decision);\n\
    \n      // [OLD CODE] Include other implementations here as required by previous tasks, such as training the AI model\n\
    \    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(`Error during demo trading: ${error.message}`);\n      // Handle error\n \
    \   }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports = TradingOrchestrator;\n\n```\n\nNow, implement the new changes into the previously implemented\
    \ file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines of code that are not in the previously coded file or the\
    \ new implementation but only combine those two.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nAll lines of code in the new implementation should\
    \ be present. From the old implementation, only take the ones that are replaced with the comment `[OLD CODE]` in the new\
    \ implementation\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nMake sure that you respond with all lines of code that are replaced by these comments,\
    \ including all control structures, error handling, and any other relevant logic that was in the original code.\nUnder\
    \ no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten. Every single line of code that exists\
    \ in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include any code that is above or below the\
    \ comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment."

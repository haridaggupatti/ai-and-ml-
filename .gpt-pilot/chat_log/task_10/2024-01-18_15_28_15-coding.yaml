  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "Here is how the file `/public/index.html/` looks like right now:\n```\n\n```\n\nAnd here is the new implementation\
    \ for the same file:\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Graf\
    \ Visualization</title>\n    <!-- [OLD CODE] Add previous head elements here -->\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- [OLD CODE]\
    \ Add other body content here -->\n    <button id=\"start-demo-button\">Start Demo Trading</button>\n    <div id=\"graf-container\"\
    ></div>\n    <script src=\"/scripts/graf.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n      document.getElementById('start-demo-button').addEventListener('click',\
    \ async () => {\n          const response = await fetch('/api/trading/start-demo-trading', { method: 'POST' });\n    \
    \      const data = await response.json();\n          console.log(data); // Or update UI with a message\n      });\n \
    \   </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n```\n\nNow, implement the new changes into the previously implemented file and return\
    \ the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines of code that are not in the previously coded file or the new implementation\
    \ but only combine those two.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nAll lines of code in the new implementation should be present. From the\
    \ old implementation, only take the ones that are replaced with the comment `[OLD CODE]` in the new implementation\n\n\
    **IMPORTANT**\nMake sure that you respond with all lines of code that are replaced by these comments, including all control\
    \ structures, error handling, and any other relevant logic that was in the original code.\nUnder no circumstances should\
    \ you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten. Every single line of code that exists in the place where the\
    \ comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include any code that is above or below the comment but only the\
    \ code that should be in the position of the comment."

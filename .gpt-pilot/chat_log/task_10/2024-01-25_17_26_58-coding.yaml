  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "Here is how the file `ai/strategyModel.js` looks like right now:\n```\nconst tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');\n\
    require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node');\nconst { sequential, layers } = tf;\n\n// Define the model architecture\nconst buildModel\
    \ = (inputShape) => {\n  const model = sequential();\n  model.add(layers.dense({ units: 64, activation: 'relu', inputShape:\
    \ [inputShape] }));\n  model.add(layers.dense({ units: 64, activation: 'relu' }));\n  model.add(layers.dense({ units:\
    \ 1, activation: 'sigmoid' }));\n\n  model.compile({\n    optimizer: tf.train.adam(),\n    loss: 'binaryCrossentropy',\n\
    \    metrics: ['accuracy'],\n  });\n\n  return model;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  buildModel,\n};\n```\n\nAnd here is\
    \ the new implementation for the same file:\n```\nconst tf = require('../utils/tf');\n\n// [OLD CODE] Replace the rest\
    \ of the file content here as it was previously implemented in strategyModel.js\n```\n\nNow, implement the new changes\
    \ into the previously implemented file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines of code that are not in\
    \ the previously coded file or the new implementation but only combine those two.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nAll lines of code\
    \ in the new implementation should be present. From the old implementation, only take the ones that are replaced with\
    \ the comment `[OLD CODE]` in the new implementation\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nMake sure that you respond with all lines of code\
    \ that are replaced by these comments, including all control structures, error handling, and any other relevant logic\
    \ that was in the original code.\nUnder no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten.\
    \ Every single line of code that exists in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include\
    \ any code that is above or below the comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment."

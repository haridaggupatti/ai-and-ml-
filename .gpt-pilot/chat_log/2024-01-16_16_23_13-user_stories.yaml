- role: system
  content: You are an experienced project owner (project manager) who manages the entire process of creating software applications
    for clients from the client specifications to the development. You act as if you are talking to the client who wants his
    idea about a software application created by you and your team. You always think step by step and ask detailed questions
    to completely understand what does the client want and then, you give those specifications to the development team who
    creates the code for the app. Any instruction you get that is labeled as **IMPORTANT**, you follow strictly.

  content: "I want you to create App (let's call it \"ai_and_ml_\") that can be described like this:\n```\nThe project will\
    \ encompass the development of a software application, designated as \"ai_and_ml_\", designed to interface with MetaTrader\
    \ 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platforms via APIs, webhooks, or HTTP protocols. The application will perform analysis\
    \ and execute trades automatically within the financial markets, supporting all trading instruments available on these\
    \ platforms.\n\nKey features of \"ai_and_ml_\" will include:\n\n- A decision-making engine using artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI) and machine learning (ML) to autonomously determine when to execute trades.\n- Customizable user-defined trading\
    \ strategies, which once written and saved in normal language, allow the application to trade based on specific methods\
    \ like martingale, averaging, high-frequency trading (HFT), or bespoke strategies.\n- A visual graphical representation\
    \ (Graf) for tracking account growth, providing insights and advice for strategy improvement.\n- The capability to learn\
    \ and evolve its decision-making process through the analysis of historical data, factoring in real-time market behaviors\
    \ and user feedback.\n- An AI component that employs statistical analysis, machine learning models, and deep learning\
    \ to analyze historical data, with a caution against overfitting and market evolution.\n- Processing of real-time market\
    \ data through advanced algorithms to respond to live market changes, coupled with challenges related to data volatility.\n\
    - A mechanism for user feedback incorporation, allowing personalization of the AI and adjustment of trading strategies\
    \ and risk management rules.\n- A comprehensive integration of these elements for continuous learning and adaptation,\
    \ using techniques such as online learning and reinforcement learning, while ensuring ethical and regulatory compliance.\n\
    - Risk management features with AI and ML creating autonomous decisions on aspects such as stop-loss and take-profit parameters.\n\
    - A secure user authentication system to control access to personal trading strategies and performance analytics.\n\n\
    The AI and ML components will be developed to progressively enhance their decision-making capabilities while conforming\
    \ to ethical standards and financial regulations. The system aims to balance customization, user experience, and financial\
    \ efficacy, requiring continuous monitoring and adjustment for optimal performance.\n```\n\n\nHere are some additional\
    \ questions and answers to clarify the App description:\n```\n\n    \n    Q: all \n    \n\n    \n    A: Should the app\
    \ implement any specific risk management features, such as stop-loss or take-profit parameters?\n    \n\n    \n    Q:\
    \ yes we have to devolpe it like it has to take his own disicion we have devolpe ai amd ml \n    \n\n    \n    A: What\
    \ level of customization will be required for users to define their own trading strategies within the app?\n    \n\n \
    \   \n    Q: give a opation to make costimaze \n    \n\n    \n    A: Will the app require a user authentication system\
    \ to manage access to personal trading strategies and performance data?\n    \n\n    \n    Q: yes \n    \n\n    \n   \
    \ A: How should the app's AI component learn and improve its trading decisions over time? Through historical data analysis,\
    \ real-time market data, user feedback, or a combination of these?\n    \n\n    \n    Q: Historical Data Analysis:\n\n\
    Importance: Historical data provides a wealth of information about market behavior under different conditions. By analyzing\
    \ past price movements, economic indicators, and other relevant financial data, the AI can identify patterns, trends,\
    \ and correlations that are crucial for making informed trading decisions.\nMethods: Techniques like statistical analysis,\
    \ machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification, time series forecasting), and deep learning (e.g., neural\
    \ networks) can be employed to understand historical data.\nChallenges: Over-reliance on historical data can lead to issues\
    \ like overfitting, where the model performs well on past data but poorly on new, unseen data. Markets also evolve, and\
    \ past patterns may not always predict future movements.\nReal-Time Market Data:\n\nImportance: Financial markets are\
    \ dynamic and influenced by a myriad of factors, including geopolitical events, economic reports, and market sentiment.\
    \ Real-time data allows the AI to respond promptly to current market conditions.\nMethods: The AI should incorporate algorithms\
    \ capable of processing and analyzing real-time data streams. This might include high-frequency trading algorithms, news\
    \ sentiment analysis, and anomaly detection.\nChallenges: Real-time data can be noisy and volatile. The AI needs to distinguish\
    \ between short-term fluctuations and significant trends.\nUser Feedback:\n\nImportance: User feedback helps tailor the\
    \ AI to individual preferences and improve user experience. Different traders have different risk tolerances, trading\
    \ styles, and goals.\nMethods: Incorporate mechanisms for users to provide feedback on the AI's performance and suggestions.\
    \ Use this feedback to adjust the AI's trading strategies, risk management rules, and even user interface.\nChallenges:\
    \ User feedback can be subjective and may not always align with optimal trading strategies. Balancing user preferences\
    \ with sound financial principles is key.\nCombination and Integration:\n\nSynergy: The most effective approach is to\
    \ integrate these methods. Historical data provides a foundational understanding, real-time data offers immediacy, and\
    \ user feedback ensures personalization and adaptability.\nImplementation: Develop a system where these components feed\
    \ into each other. For example, real-time market reactions can be used to refine historical models, while user feedback\
    \ can help prioritize which real-time data is most relevant.\nContinuous Learning and Adaptation:\n\nMachine Learning\
    \ Techniques: Use online learning, reinforcement learning, or adaptive algorithms that can update their parameters in\
    \ response to new data and feedback.\nMonitoring and Maintenance: Regularly monitor the AI's performance and intervene\
    \ when necessary to adjust models, especially in response to market regime changes or unusual events.\nEthical and Regulatory\
    \ Considerations:\n\nEnsure that the AI's learning and decision-making processes are transparent, fair, and compliant\
    \ with financial regulations. This includes considerations around data privacy, market manipulation, and ensuring that\
    \ the AI does not engage in unethical trading practices.\n    \n\n```\n\n\nThink step by step about the description for\
    \ the App \"ai_and_ml_\" and the additional questions and answers and break down user stories. You will think about the\
    \ App description and the answers listed and create a list of all user stories. A user story is a description of how a\
    \ user can interact with the App. For example, if an app's description is `Create a script that finds Youtube channels\
    \ with the word \"test\" inside the channel name`, user stories could be:\n- `user will run the script from the CLI`\n\
    - `user will get the list of all channels in a CSV file`\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nReturn one user story at the time. Do not return\
    \ anything else but single user story. I might ask you to modify some user stories and only when I send you empty response\
    \ you can move to next user story.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nOnce you are done creating all user stories, write the response containing\
    \ nothing else but this:\nEVERYTHING_CLEAR"
response: User will authenticate through a secure login system to access personal trading strategies and performance analytics.

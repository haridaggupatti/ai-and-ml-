  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "Here is how the file `./ai/decisionMaker.js/` looks like right now:\n```\n\n```\n\nAnd here is the new implementation\
    \ for the same file:\n```\nconst { applyFeedbackToStrategy } = require('../services/strategyService');\n\nexports.makeDecision\
    \ = async (userId, baseStrategyConfig, marketData) => {\n  let strategyConfig = await applyFeedbackToStrategy(userId,\
    \ baseStrategyConfig);\n  \n  // AI decision making process with the updated strategyConfig\n  // ...\n\n  // [OLD CODE]\
    \ Insert the prior decision making logic here that utilizes strategyConfig\n\n  return decision;\n};\n\n```\n\nNow, implement\
    \ the new changes into the previously implemented file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines of code\
    \ that are not in the previously coded file or the new implementation but only combine those two.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nAll\
    \ lines of code in the new implementation should be present. From the old implementation, only take the ones that are\
    \ replaced with the comment `[OLD CODE]` in the new implementation\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nMake sure that you respond with all\
    \ lines of code that are replaced by these comments, including all control structures, error handling, and any other relevant\
    \ logic that was in the original code.\nUnder no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten.\
    \ Every single line of code that exists in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include\
    \ any code that is above or below the comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment."

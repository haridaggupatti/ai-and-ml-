  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "Here is how the file `services/riskManagementService.js` looks like right now:\n```\nclass RiskManagementService\
    \ {\n  constructor(model) {\n    this.model = model;\n  }\n\n  async calculateRiskParameters(marketData) {\n    const\
    \ riskParameters = await this.model.predict(marketData);\n    const stopLossLevel = riskParameters.stopLoss;\n    const\
    \ takeProfitLevel = riskParameters.takeProfit;\n    return {\n      stopLoss: stopLossLevel,\n      takeProfit: takeProfitLevel\n\
    \    };\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = RiskManagementService;\n```\n\nAnd here is the new implementation for the same file:\n\
    ```\nconst ExternalLearningService = require('./externalLearningService');\n\nclass RiskManagementService {\n  constructor(model,\
    \ externalLearningEndpoint) {\n    this.model = model;\n    this.externalLearningService = new ExternalLearningService(externalLearningEndpoint);\n\
    \  }\n\n  async updateModelWithExternalData() {\n    const information = await this.externalLearningService.gatherInformation();\n\
    \    await this.model.updateModelWithExternalData(information);\n  }\n\n  // [OLD CODE] Keep existing methods such as\
    \ calculateRiskParameters\n}\n\nmodule.exports = RiskManagementService;\n\n```\n\nNow, implement the new changes into\
    \ the previously implemented file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines of code that are not in the\
    \ previously coded file or the new implementation but only combine those two.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nAll lines of code in the\
    \ new implementation should be present. From the old implementation, only take the ones that are replaced with the comment\
    \ `[OLD CODE]` in the new implementation\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nMake sure that you respond with all lines of code that are\
    \ replaced by these comments, including all control structures, error handling, and any other relevant logic that was\
    \ in the original code.\nUnder no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten. Every single\
    \ line of code that exists in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include any code\
    \ that is above or below the comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment."

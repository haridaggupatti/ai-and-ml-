  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "Here is how the file `services/externalLearningService.js/` looks like right now:\n```\n\n```\n\nAnd here is the\
    \ new implementation for the same file:\n```\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\nclass ExternalLearningService {\n  constructor(apiEndpoint)\
    \ {\n    this.apiEndpoint = apiEndpoint;\n  }\n\n  async gatherInformation() {\n    try {\n      const response = await\
    \ axios.get(this.apiEndpoint);\n      // [OLD CODE] Parse and return the useful information from the response\n      return\
    \ response.data;\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(`Error gathering external information: ${error.message}`);\n\
    \      throw error;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = ExternalLearningService;\n\n```\n\nNow, implement the new changes\
    \ into the previously implemented file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines of code that are not in\
    \ the previously coded file or the new implementation but only combine those two.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nAll lines of code\
    \ in the new implementation should be present. From the old implementation, only take the ones that are replaced with\
    \ the comment `[OLD CODE]` in the new implementation\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nMake sure that you respond with all lines of code\
    \ that are replaced by these comments, including all control structures, error handling, and any other relevant logic\
    \ that was in the original code.\nUnder no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten.\
    \ Every single line of code that exists in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include\
    \ any code that is above or below the comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment."

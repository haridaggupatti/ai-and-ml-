  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"ai_and_ml_\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"ai_and_ml_\":\n```\nThe project will encompass the development of a software application,\
    \ designated as \"ai_and_ml_\", designed to interface with MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platforms via APIs,\
    \ webhooks, or HTTP protocols. The application will perform analysis and execute trades automatically within the financial\
    \ markets, supporting all trading instruments available on these platforms.\n\nKey features of \"ai_and_ml_\" will include:\n\
    \n- A decision-making engine using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to autonomously determine when\
    \ to execute trades.\n- Customizable user-defined trading strategies, which once written and saved in normal language,\
    \ allow the application to trade based on specific methods like martingale, averaging, high-frequency trading (HFT), or\
    \ bespoke strategies.\n- A visual graphical representation (Graf) for tracking account growth, providing insights and\
    \ advice for strategy improvement.\n- The capability to learn and evolve its decision-making process through the analysis\
    \ of historical data, factoring in real-time market behaviors and user feedback.\n- An AI component that employs statistical\
    \ analysis, machine learning models, and deep learning to analyze historical data, with a caution against overfitting\
    \ and market evolution.\n- Processing of real-time market data through advanced algorithms to respond to live market changes,\
    \ coupled with challenges related to data volatility.\n- A mechanism for user feedback incorporation, allowing personalization\
    \ of the AI and adjustment of trading strategies and risk management rules.\n- A comprehensive integration of these elements\
    \ for continuous learning and adaptation, using techniques such as online learning and reinforcement learning, while ensuring\
    \ ethical and regulatory compliance.\n- Risk management features with AI and ML creating autonomous decisions on aspects\
    \ such as stop-loss and take-profit parameters.\n- A secure user authentication system to control access to personal trading\
    \ strategies and performance analytics.\n\nThe AI and ML components will be developed to progressively enhance their decision-making\
    \ capabilities while conforming to ethical standards and financial regulations. The system aims to balance customization,\
    \ user experience, and financial efficacy, requiring continuous monitoring and adjustment for optimal performance.\n```\n\
    \nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- MongoDB\n- PeeWee\n- Bootstrap\n\
    - HTML\n- CSS3\n- Socket.io\n- TensorFlow\n- Keras\n- scikit-learn\n- pandas\n- NumPy\n- matplotlib\n- D3.js\n- axios\n\
    - JWT\n- bcrypt\n- MetaApi SDK\n- cheerio\n- express\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller\
    \ tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project structure with Node.js, set up an Express server,\
    \ and create a default route.\n\n2. Set up secure authentication and user account management using JWT and bcrypt.\n\n\
    3. Install and configure the MetaApi SDK to establish connectivity with MetaTrader platforms.\n\n4. Create the base AI\
    \ decision-making engine structure with TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn, allowing the input of user-defined strategies.\n\
    \n5. Implement the data processing module to fetch and prepare real-time market data for analysis.\n\n6. Design and implement\
    \ the Graf visualization component using D3.js that dynamically displays account growth and strategy insights.\n\n7. Develop\
    \ the user feedback mechanism to personalize AI strategies and risk management rules.\n\n8. Implement risk management\
    \ algorithms to autonomously calculate stop-loss and take-profit parameters based on AI and ML recommendations.\n\n9.\
    \ Incorporate real-time news analysis into the trading algorithm using cheerio and axios to parse news feeds.\n\n10. Finalize\
    \ and integrate all components into a cohesive system with an initial testing phase on a demo trading account.\n\n```\n\

    \ the connection\nChecking the proxy and the firewall\nERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED\nit was giting like this \n```\n\nCan you\
    \ debug this issue or implement changes to comply with the additional user input?\n\nTell me all the new code that needs\
    \ to be written or modified to implement current task and have it fully working. You can count that the environment is\
    \ set up previously and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new\
    \ dependencies, if there are any.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always\
    \ try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file\
    \ becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any automated\
    \ tests work.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related - only if\
    \ some dependencies need to be installed."

  content: "Based on the information provided and the error message received from your colleague, it appears the issue might\
    \ be related to the server not running properly, which causes the connection to be refused when attempting to access the\
    \ localhost.\n\nLet's go through some possible issues and solutions within the context of our Node.js application setup:\n\
    \n1. **Server Not Running**:\n   - Ensure that Node.js server is running by executing `npm start` or `node index.js` (depending\
    \ on how `package.json` is configured under scripts).\n   - Verify that any other environment-specific issues are not\
    \ affecting the startup of the server.\n\n2. **Port Issue**:\n   - Make sure the `port` variable is correctly set in the\
    \ `index.js` file and that port `3000` is not occupied by another service.\n   - Ensure that there are no firewalls blocking\
    \ access to the specified port.\n\n3. **MongoDB Connection String**:\n   - Confirm that MongoDB is running and accessible\
    \ on `localhost` at the default port.\n   - The connection string `mongodb://localhost/ai_and_ml_` might need to be updated\
    \ if MongoDB is configured differently or if authentication is required.\n\n4. **Mongoose Deprecation Warnings**:\n  \
    \ - Mongoose options are provided when connecting but may not be up-to-date with the current best practices. Ensure that\
    \ the latest recommended MongoDB connection settings are used if there are deprecation warnings.\n\nGiven all parameters\
    \ seem to be correct, the application server should start without issues. To check if the server is listening to the correct\
    \ port, it might be helpful to add a more explicit error handler to the `listen` call in `index.js`:\n\n```javascript\n\
    app.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n}).on('error', (err) => {\n  console.error(`Error\
    \ starting server: ${err.message}`);\n});\n```\n\nIf this basic troubleshooting does not resolve the connection issue,\
    \ you may need to look at network configurations or other environment-specific problems that are outside the scope of\
    \ the application code.\n\nPlease note, there doesn't seem to be missing functionality in the code provided related to\
    \ the authentication or account management tasks as per the specifications, so no additional code changes are required\
    \ for that particular task. However, if you identify any specific bugs or logical errors in the code that need to be addressed,\
    \ please provide more detail, and I will assist you with the fixes."

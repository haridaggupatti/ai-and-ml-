  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"ai_and_ml_\" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks\
    \ that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for \"\
    ai_and_ml_\" as well.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"ai_and_ml_\":\n```\nThe project will encompass the development\
    \ of a software application, designated as \"ai_and_ml_\", designed to interface with MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader\
    \ 5 (MT5) platforms via APIs, webhooks, or HTTP protocols. The application will perform analysis and execute trades automatically\
    \ within the financial markets, supporting all trading instruments available on these platforms.\n\nKey features of \"\
    ai_and_ml_\" will include:\n\n- A decision-making engine using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)\
    \ to autonomously determine when to execute trades.\n- Customizable user-defined trading strategies, which once written\
    \ and saved in normal language, allow the application to trade based on specific methods like martingale, averaging, high-frequency\
    \ trading (HFT), or bespoke strategies.\n- A visual graphical representation (Graf) for tracking account growth, providing\
    \ insights and advice for strategy improvement.\n- The capability to learn and evolve its decision-making process through\
    \ the analysis of historical data, factoring in real-time market behaviors and user feedback.\n- An AI component that\
    \ employs statistical analysis, machine learning models, and deep learning to analyze historical data, with a caution\
    \ against overfitting and market evolution.\n- Processing of real-time market data through advanced algorithms to respond\
    \ to live market changes, coupled with challenges related to data volatility.\n- A mechanism for user feedback incorporation,\
    \ allowing personalization of the AI and adjustment of trading strategies and risk management rules.\n- A comprehensive\
    \ integration of these elements for continuous learning and adaptation, using techniques such as online learning and reinforcement\
    \ learning, while ensuring ethical and regulatory compliance.\n- Risk management features with AI and ML creating autonomous\
    \ decisions on aspects such as stop-loss and take-profit parameters.\n- A secure user authentication system to control\
    \ access to personal trading strategies and performance analytics.\n\nThe AI and ML components will be developed to progressively\
    \ enhance their decision-making capabilities while conforming to ethical standards and financial regulations. The system\
    \ aims to balance customization, user experience, and financial efficacy, requiring continuous monitoring and adjustment\
    \ for optimal performance.\n```\n\n\nHere are user stories that specify how users use \"ai_and_ml_\":\n```\n\n- User will\
    \ receive trade execution with above 80% accuracy through the application's use of neural networks and advanced technologies.\n\
    \n- User will have the application analyze online news sources to inform trading decisions and update the AI with relevant\
    \ information daily.\n\n```\n\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n\n- Node.js\n\n\
    - MongoDB\n\n- PeeWee\n\n- Bootstrap\n\n- HTML\n\n- CSS3\n\n- Socket.io\n\n- TensorFlow\n\n- Keras\n\n- scikit-learn\n\
    \n- pandas\n\n- NumPy\n\n- matplotlib\n\n- D3.js\n\n- axios\n\n- JWT\n\n- bcrypt\n\n- MetaApi SDK\n\n- cheerio\n\n- express\n\
    \n```\n\n\n\n\nSo far, this code has been implemented:\n\n**/package.json**\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"ai_and_ml_\",\n  \"\
    version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"\
    Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"\
    dependencies\": {\n    \"express\": \"^4.18.2\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**/index.js**\n```\nconst express = require('express');\n\
    const app = express();\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000; // Choose a port other than 5000\n\napp.get('/ping', (req,\
    \ res) => {\n  res.send('pong');\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\
    \ // INPUT_REQUIRED {Add your desired log message or remove comment}\n});\n```\n\n\n\n\nWe've broken the development of\
    \ this app down to these tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project structure with Node.js, set up an Express server, and\
    \ create a default route.\n\n2. Set up secure authentication and user account management using JWT and bcrypt.\n\n3. Install\
    \ and configure the MetaApi SDK to establish connectivity with MetaTrader platforms.\n\n4. Create the base AI decision-making\
    \ engine structure with TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn, allowing the input of user-defined strategies.\n\n5. Implement\
    \ the data processing module to fetch and prepare real-time market data for analysis.\n\n6. Design and implement the Graf\
    \ visualization component using D3.js that dynamically displays account growth and strategy insights.\n\n7. Develop the\
    \ user feedback mechanism to personalize AI strategies and risk management rules.\n\n8. Implement risk management algorithms\
    \ to autonomously calculate stop-loss and take-profit parameters based on AI and ML recommendations.\n\n9. Incorporate\
    \ real-time news analysis into the trading algorithm using cheerio and axios to parse news feeds.\n\n10. Finalize and\
    \ integrate all components into a cohesive system with an initial testing phase on a demo trading account.\n\n```\n\n\
    You are currently working on task #2 with the following description:\n```\nSet up secure authentication and user account\
    \ management using JWT and bcrypt.\n```\nAll previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.\nAfter all\
    \ the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `A user should be able to register and\
    \ subsequently log in, with invalid attempts properly rejected.`\n\nNow, tell me all the code that needs to be written\
    \ to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that need to be run to implement this task.\n\
    \n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible\
    \ and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines\
    \ of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nRemember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing\
    \ files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\nDO NOT\
    \ specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative path\
    \ to each file that needs to be written.\n\nNever use the port 5000 to run the app, it's reserved."

  content: "To set up secure authentication and user account management using JWT and bcrypt, we will need to:\n\n1. Create\
    \ user models\n2. Implement password hashing\n3. Establish JWT handling\n4. Build authentication endpoints\n5. Write middlewares\
    \ to handle protected routes\n\nLet's start implementing the necessary changes step by step.\n\n**First**, let's install\
    \ our required packages:\n```\nnpm install bcrypt jsonwebtoken dotenv\n```\n\n**Second**, we'll set up environment variables\
    \ to store our secret key for JWT.\n\n**/.env**\n```\nJWT_SECRET=YourVerySecretKey\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `YourVerySecretKey`\
    \ with a strong, randomly generated key in a real application.\n\n**Third**, we're going to create our user model, which\
    \ should encapsulate user data and password hashing functionality.\n\n**/models/User.js**\n```javascript\nconst mongoose\
    \ = require('mongoose');\nconst bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');\n\nconst UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  username:\
    \ {\n    type: String,\n    unique: true,\n    required: true\n  },\n  password: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n\
    \  }\n});\n\nUserSchema.pre('save', function(next) {\n  if (this.isModified('password') || this.isNew) {\n    const salt\
    \ = bcrypt.genSaltSync(10);\n    this.password = bcrypt.hashSync(this.password, salt);\n  }\n  next();\n});\n\nUserSchema.methods.comparePassword\
    \ = function(pw, cb) {\n  bcrypt.compare(pw, this.password, (err, isMatch) => {\n    if (err) {\n      return cb(err);\n\
    \    }\n    cb(null, isMatch);\n  });\n};\n\nmodule.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);\n```\n\n**Fourth**,\
    \ we need to write the JWT utility functions to handle token generation and verification.\n\n**/utils/jwtUtils.js**\n\
    ```javascript\nconst jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');\nrequire('dotenv').config();\n\nconst JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET;\n\
    \nconst generateToken = (user) => {\n  return jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, JWT_SECRET);\n};\n\nconst verifyToken = (token)\
    \ => {\n  try {\n    return jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);\n  } catch (e) {\n    return null;\n  }\n};\n\nmodule.exports\
    \ = {\n  generateToken,\n  verifyToken\n};\n```\n\n**Fifth**, let's set up our authentication routes.\n\n**/routes/authRoutes.js**\n\
    ```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst User = require('../models/User');\nconst bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');\n\
    const { generateToken } = require('../utils/jwtUtils');\n\nconst router = express.Router();\n\nrouter.post('/register',\
    \ async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const { username, password } = req.body;\n    let user = await User.findOne({ username\
    \ });\n    \n    if (user) {\n      return res.status(400).json({ message: 'User already exists' });\n    }\n\n    user\
    \ = new User({ username, password });\n    await user.save();\n    \n    const token = generateToken(user);\n    res.status(201).json({\
    \ token });\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error registering new user' });\n  }\n});\n\nrouter.post('/login',\
    \ async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const { username, password } = req.body;\n    const user = await User.findOne({\
    \ username });\n\n    if (!user) {\n      return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Authentication failed. User not found.'\
    \ });\n    }\n\n    user.comparePassword(password, (err, isMatch) => {\n      if (isMatch && !err) {\n        const token\
    \ = generateToken(user);\n        res.json({ token });\n      } else {\n        res.status(401).json({ message: 'Authentication\
    \ failed. Wrong password.' });\n      }\n    });\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error logging\
    \ in user' });\n  }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n```\n\n**Sixth**, we will need to create middleware for protecting\
    \ routes that require authentication.\n\n**/middlewares/authMiddleware.js**\n```javascript\nconst { verifyToken } = require('../utils/jwtUtils');\n\
    \nconst authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {\n  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1]; // Expecting\
    \ \"Bearer TOKEN_STRING\"\n  const verifiedToken = verifyToken(token);\n\n  if (!verifiedToken) {\n    return res.status(401).json({\
    \ message: 'Unauthorized access' });\n  }\n\n  req.user = verifiedToken;\n  next();\n};\n\nmodule.exports = authMiddleware;\n\
    ```\n\n**Seventh**, let's integrate our new auth routes into our main app.\n\nReconfigure **/index.js**\n```javascript\n\
    require('dotenv').config();\nconst express = require('express');\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst bodyParser\
    \ = require('body-parser');\nconst authRoutes = require('./routes/authRoutes');\nconst app = express();\nconst port =\
    \ process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\nmongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/ai_and_ml_', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology:\
    \ true });\n\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\napp.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);\n\napp.get('/ping', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('pong');\n\
    });\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n**Finally**, run MongoDB\
    \ if it's not already running:\n```\nmongod\n```\n\nWith the database running, you should now be able to start your application\
    \ with:\n```\nnode index.js\n```\n\nNow users should be able to register and subsequently log in, with invalid attempts\
    \ properly rejected, completing task #2."

  content: 'Ok, now, take your previous message and convert it to actionable items. An item might be a code change or a command
    run. When you need to change code, make sure that you put the entire content of the file in the value of `content` key

    machine.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Within the file modifications, anything needs to be written by the user, add the comment in the same line as the code
    that starts with `// INPUT_REQUIRED {input_description}` where `input_description` is a description of what needs to be
    added here by the user. Just make sure that you put comments only inside files that support comments (e.g. not in JSON
    files).


    **IMPORTANT**

    When you want to add a comment that tells the user to add the previous implementation at that place, make sure that the
    comment starts with `[OLD CODE]` and add a description of what old code should be inserted here. For example, `[OLD CODE]
    Login route`.


    **IMPORTANT**

    When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code
    in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split

  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"ai_and_ml_\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"ai_and_ml_\":\n```\nThe project will encompass the development of a software application,\
    \ designated as \"ai_and_ml_\", designed to interface with MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platforms via APIs,\
    \ webhooks, or HTTP protocols. The application will perform analysis and execute trades automatically within the financial\
    \ markets, supporting all trading instruments available on these platforms.\n\nKey features of \"ai_and_ml_\" will include:\n\
    \n- A decision-making engine using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to autonomously determine when\
    \ to execute trades.\n- Customizable user-defined trading strategies, which once written and saved in normal language,\
    \ allow the application to trade based on specific methods like martingale, averaging, high-frequency trading (HFT), or\
    \ bespoke strategies.\n- A visual graphical representation (Graf) for tracking account growth, providing insights and\
    \ advice for strategy improvement.\n- The capability to learn and evolve its decision-making process through the analysis\
    \ of historical data, factoring in real-time market behaviors and user feedback.\n- An AI component that employs statistical\
    \ analysis, machine learning models, and deep learning to analyze historical data, with a caution against overfitting\
    \ and market evolution.\n- Processing of real-time market data through advanced algorithms to respond to live market changes,\
    \ coupled with challenges related to data volatility.\n- A mechanism for user feedback incorporation, allowing personalization\
    \ of the AI and adjustment of trading strategies and risk management rules.\n- A comprehensive integration of these elements\
    \ for continuous learning and adaptation, using techniques such as online learning and reinforcement learning, while ensuring\
    \ ethical and regulatory compliance.\n- Risk management features with AI and ML creating autonomous decisions on aspects\
    \ such as stop-loss and take-profit parameters.\n- A secure user authentication system to control access to personal trading\
    \ strategies and performance analytics.\n\nThe AI and ML components will be developed to progressively enhance their decision-making\
    \ capabilities while conforming to ethical standards and financial regulations. The system aims to balance customization,\
    \ user experience, and financial efficacy, requiring continuous monitoring and adjustment for optimal performance.\n```\n\
    \nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- MongoDB\n- PeeWee\n- Bootstrap\n\
    - HTML\n- CSS3\n- Socket.io\n- TensorFlow\n- Keras\n- scikit-learn\n- pandas\n- NumPy\n- matplotlib\n- D3.js\n- axios\n\
    - JWT\n- bcrypt\n- MetaApi SDK\n- cheerio\n- express\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller\
    \ tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project structure with Node.js, set up an Express server,\
    \ and create a default route.\n\n2. Set up secure authentication and user account management using JWT and bcrypt.\n\n\
    3. Install and configure the MetaApi SDK to establish connectivity with MetaTrader platforms.\n\n4. Create the base AI\
    \ decision-making engine structure with TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn, allowing the input of user-defined strategies.\n\
    \n5. Implement the data processing module to fetch and prepare real-time market data for analysis.\n\n6. Design and implement\
    \ the Graf visualization component using D3.js that dynamically displays account growth and strategy insights.\n\n7. Develop\
    \ the user feedback mechanism to personalize AI strategies and risk management rules.\n\n8. Implement risk management\
    \ algorithms to autonomously calculate stop-loss and take-profit parameters based on AI and ML recommendations.\n\n9.\
    \ Incorporate real-time news analysis into the trading algorithm using cheerio and axios to parse news feeds.\n\n10. Finalize\
    \ and integrate all components into a cohesive system with an initial testing phase on a demo trading account.\n\n```\n\

  content: "Based on the error message provided by your colleague, the issue seems to be that `npm start` is trying to locate\
    \ a `package.json` file which does not exist in the specified directory (`C:\\Users\\Daggu\\gpt-pilot\\workspace`). Here\
    \ are the steps you need to take to resolve this issue:\n\n- Ensure that your colleague navigates to the correct directory\
    \ where the `package.json` file is located before running the `npm start` command. The error indicates that they might\
    \ not be in the correct working directory.\n  \n  ```\n  cd path_to_ai_and_ml_app_root_directory\n  npm start\n  ```\n\
    \n- If the `package.json` file actually does not exist in the correct directory, make sure that it is properly restored.\n\
    \nConsidering that the files listed in your message (such as `index.js`, `authRoutes.js`, etc.) are already implemented,\
    \ you won't need to install any new dependencies, as none were mentioned for the current task. \n\nHowever, I noticed\
    \ that in your `.env` file, the `JWT_SECRET` reads `YourVerySecretKey // INPUT_REQUIRED {...}`, for security and functionality\
    \ purposes, ensure that you provide an actual secret key, e.g., a long random string. Here's an update you should consider:\n\
    \n**/.env**\nReplace the placeholder with an actual secret key:\n```\nJWT_SECRET=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJSb2xlIjoiQWRtaW4iLCJJc3N1ZXIiOiJJc3N1ZXIiLCJVc2VybmFtZSI6IkphdmFJblVzZSIsImV4cCI6MTcwNTQ5MTI5NiwiaWF0IjoxNzA1NDkxMjk2fQ.qpjSB8WwIMZHDxibCvmvu26HsGhCtpm5yMig69JfCrU\n\
    ```\n\n**Note**: Make sure to generate and use a unique and secret key for `JWT_SECRET` in production.\n\nLastly, review\
    \ the JWT utility functions to ensure they correctly handle errors:\n\n**utils/jwtUtils.js**\n```javascript\nconst jwt\
    \ = require('jsonwebtoken');\nrequire('dotenv').config();\n\nconst JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET;\n\nif (!JWT_SECRET\
    \ || JWT_SECRET.length < 64) {\n  throw new Error('JWT_SECRET is undefined or too short. Please set a proper JWT_SECRET\
    \ in your .env file.');\n}\n\nconst generateToken = (user) => {\n  return jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, JWT_SECRET, {\
    \ expiresIn: '1h' }); // Consider setting an expiration for the token\n};\n\nconst verifyToken = (token) => {\n  try {\n\
    \    return jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.error(e); // Log the actual error message for\
    \ easier debugging\n    return null;\n  }\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  generateToken,\n  verifyToken\n};\n```\n\nNo new\
    \ code needs to be written or appended to the files given your task assignment except for updating the `.env` file with\
    \ a proper JWT secret and reviewing the JWT utility functions for error handling completeness. Make sure your colleague\
    \ navigates to the correct directory and has access to the appropriate `package.json` file before running the `npm start`\
    \ command."

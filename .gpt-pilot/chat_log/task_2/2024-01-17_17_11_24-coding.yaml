  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"ai_and_ml_\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"ai_and_ml_\":\n```\nThe project will encompass the development of a software application,\
    \ designated as \"ai_and_ml_\", designed to interface with MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platforms via APIs,\
    \ webhooks, or HTTP protocols. The application will perform analysis and execute trades automatically within the financial\
    \ markets, supporting all trading instruments available on these platforms.\n\nKey features of \"ai_and_ml_\" will include:\n\
    \n- A decision-making engine using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to autonomously determine when\
    \ to execute trades.\n- Customizable user-defined trading strategies, which once written and saved in normal language,\
    \ allow the application to trade based on specific methods like martingale, averaging, high-frequency trading (HFT), or\
    \ bespoke strategies.\n- A visual graphical representation (Graf) for tracking account growth, providing insights and\
    \ advice for strategy improvement.\n- The capability to learn and evolve its decision-making process through the analysis\
    \ of historical data, factoring in real-time market behaviors and user feedback.\n- An AI component that employs statistical\
    \ analysis, machine learning models, and deep learning to analyze historical data, with a caution against overfitting\
    \ and market evolution.\n- Processing of real-time market data through advanced algorithms to respond to live market changes,\
    \ coupled with challenges related to data volatility.\n- A mechanism for user feedback incorporation, allowing personalization\
    \ of the AI and adjustment of trading strategies and risk management rules.\n- A comprehensive integration of these elements\
    \ for continuous learning and adaptation, using techniques such as online learning and reinforcement learning, while ensuring\
    \ ethical and regulatory compliance.\n- Risk management features with AI and ML creating autonomous decisions on aspects\
    \ such as stop-loss and take-profit parameters.\n- A secure user authentication system to control access to personal trading\
    \ strategies and performance analytics.\n\nThe AI and ML components will be developed to progressively enhance their decision-making\
    \ capabilities while conforming to ethical standards and financial regulations. The system aims to balance customization,\
    \ user experience, and financial efficacy, requiring continuous monitoring and adjustment for optimal performance.\n```\n\
    \nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- MongoDB\n- PeeWee\n- Bootstrap\n\
    - HTML\n- CSS3\n- Socket.io\n- TensorFlow\n- Keras\n- scikit-learn\n- pandas\n- NumPy\n- matplotlib\n- D3.js\n- axios\n\
    - JWT\n- bcrypt\n- MetaApi SDK\n- cheerio\n- express\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller\
    \ tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project structure with Node.js, set up an Express server,\
    \ and create a default route.\n\n2. Set up secure authentication and user account management using JWT and bcrypt.\n\n\
    3. Install and configure the MetaApi SDK to establish connectivity with MetaTrader platforms.\n\n4. Create the base AI\
    \ decision-making engine structure with TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn, allowing the input of user-defined strategies.\n\
    \n5. Implement the data processing module to fetch and prepare real-time market data for analysis.\n\n6. Design and implement\
    \ the Graf visualization component using D3.js that dynamically displays account growth and strategy insights.\n\n7. Develop\
    \ the user feedback mechanism to personalize AI strategies and risk management rules.\n\n8. Implement risk management\
    \ algorithms to autonomously calculate stop-loss and take-profit parameters based on AI and ML recommendations.\n\n9.\
    \ Incorporate real-time news analysis into the trading algorithm using cheerio and axios to parse news feeds.\n\n10. Finalize\
    \ and integrate all components into a cohesive system with an initial testing phase on a demo trading account.\n\n```\n\

  content: "Based on the information provided and the task at hand, we can assume that the user authentication system and\

    \ directly indicate a problem or issue with the current implementation within the context of the task:\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\\
    Daggu\\Downloads\\mongosh-2.1.1-win32-x64\\mongosh-2.1.1-win32-x64\\bin\n```\n\nThis path appears to be where the MongoDB\
    \ Shell (mongosh) is installed on your colleague's machine. It does not relate to the implementation of your task or provide\
    \ any actionable debug information unless your colleague was trying to inform you about how to access MongoDB locally,\
    \ which is not part of your task. Your task is to focus on user authentication and account management within the Node.js\
    \ application you\u2019re developing.\n\nGiven the task and the current state of the app implementation:\n\n1. Your `authRoutes.js`\
    \ handles the registration and login processes as expected. It makes use of bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for token\
    \ generation.\n2. The `authMiddleware.js` provides a middleware function to protect routes by verifying JWT tokens.\n\
    3. The `User` model in `models/User.js` includes pre-save hook for password hashing and a method for password comparison\
    \ during login.\n\nAssuming that all other systems are configured correctly (MongoDB, Node.js environment), the code for\
    \ handling authentication and user management appears complete for this stage of the task.\n\nAs a full-stack developer,\
    \ you may also consider implementing the following enhancements, depending on your tech lead's requirements and the task\
    \ description:\n\n- Add error handling for the `/register` and `/login` endpoints, including more detailed responses for\
    \ different kinds of errors.\n- Securely handle and store secrets such as `JWT_SECRET` using environment variable management\
    \ practices or secret management tools.\n- If needed, write the user-related endpoints incrementally to keep file sizes\
    \ manageable. Based on the current size of `authRoutes.js`, this doesn't seem necessary yet.\n\nRemember that you won't\
    \ need to add any new dependencies as everything needed for this task has been installed already. Ensure you follow the\
    \ team's coding standards and practices for writing clean and modular code, which may include refactoring existing structures.\n\
    \nNo new code needs to be written here unless there are specific features or changes requested that are not apparent from\
    \ your tech lead's input or the colleague's additional information. If your colleague has run into an issue they haven't\
    \ clearly articulated, you'll need more precise error descriptions or steps to reproduce the problem to be able to debug\
    \ effectively."

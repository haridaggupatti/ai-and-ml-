  content: 'You are working in a software development agency and a project manager approached you telling you that you''re
    assigned to work on a new project. You  are working on a App called "ai_and_ml_" and you need to create specifications
    on what technologies should be used in this project.


    Here is a high level description of "ai_and_ml_":

    ```

    The project will encompass the development of a software application, designated as "ai_and_ml_", designed to interface
    with MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platforms via APIs, webhooks, or HTTP protocols. The application will perform
    analysis and execute trades automatically within the financial markets, supporting all trading instruments available on
    these platforms.


    Key features of "ai_and_ml_" will include:


    - A decision-making engine using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to autonomously determine when
    to execute trades.

    - Customizable user-defined trading strategies, which once written and saved in normal language, allow the application
    to trade based on specific methods like martingale, averaging, high-frequency trading (HFT), or bespoke strategies.

    - A visual graphical representation (Graf) for tracking account growth, providing insights and advice for strategy improvement.

    - The capability to learn and evolve its decision-making process through the analysis of historical data, factoring in
    real-time market behaviors and user feedback.

    - An AI component that employs statistical analysis, machine learning models, and deep learning to analyze historical
    data, with a caution against overfitting and market evolution.

    - Processing of real-time market data through advanced algorithms to respond to live market changes, coupled with challenges
    related to data volatility.

    - A mechanism for user feedback incorporation, allowing personalization of the AI and adjustment of trading strategies
    and risk management rules.

    - A comprehensive integration of these elements for continuous learning and adaptation, using techniques such as online
    learning and reinforcement learning, while ensuring ethical and regulatory compliance.

    - Risk management features with AI and ML creating autonomous decisions on aspects such as stop-loss and take-profit parameters.

    - A secure user authentication system to control access to personal trading strategies and performance analytics.


    The AI and ML components will be developed to progressively enhance their decision-making capabilities while conforming
    to ethical standards and financial regulations. The system aims to balance customization, user experience, and financial
    efficacy, requiring continuous monitoring and adjustment for optimal performance.

    ```



    Here are user stories that specify how users use "ai_and_ml_":

    ```


    - User will receive trade execution with above 80% accuracy through the application''s use of neural networks and advanced
    technologies.


    - User will have the application analyze online news sources to inform trading decisions and update the AI with relevant
    information daily.


    ```




    Now, based on the projects details, think step by step and list the names of the technologies that will be used by your
    development team to create the app "ai_and_ml_".

    Do not give any subjective thoughts or options, give exact technologies, for example:

    Instead of ["D3.js or other suitable charting library", "axios or other http client library"] answer with ["D3.js", "axios"].


    You do not need to list any technologies related to automated tests (like Jest, Cypress, Mocha, Selenium, etc) or  any
    technologies related to deployment (like Heroku).


    **Project Technology Guidelines**

    Relevance: Only include technologies that are essential and will be actively used in the project. Avoid mentioning any
    technologies that are not required. For example, don''t suggest MongoDB if database is not needed for project.

    Compatibility: Ensure that the listed technologies are compatible with each other. Exclude any technologies that cannot
    be integrated or used in conjunction with others. For example, Pandas (Python library) and Node.js can''t be used together.
    Another example is MongoDB (NoSQL database) and MySQL (SQL database) shouldn''t be used together unless that is specified
    in project description.

    Technology Preferences: In scenarios where multiple technology options are available for a specific project component,
    prioritize the following preferred technologies:

    - Node.js,

    - MongoDB,

    - PeeWee,

    - Bootstrap,

    - HTML,

    - CSS3,

    - cronjob,

    - Socket.io


    **IMPORTANT**

    Do not use, create or suggest any microservices. Create strictly monolithic application even if in some prompts I might
    suggest microservices might be better or more desired solution. Do your best to find a solution to any requirement without
    using microservices.'

  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: 'You are working on a App called "ai_and_ml_" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks
    that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you''re working on, you''re given other specs for "ai_and_ml_"
    as well.


    Here is a high level description of "ai_and_ml_":

    ```

    The project will encompass the development of a software application, designated as "ai_and_ml_", designed to interface
    with MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platforms via APIs, webhooks, or HTTP protocols. The application will perform
    analysis and execute trades automatically within the financial markets, supporting all trading instruments available on
    these platforms.


    Key features of "ai_and_ml_" will include:


    - A decision-making engine using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to autonomously determine when
    to execute trades.

    - Customizable user-defined trading strategies, which once written and saved in normal language, allow the application
    to trade based on specific methods like martingale, averaging, high-frequency trading (HFT), or bespoke strategies.

    - A visual graphical representation (Graf) for tracking account growth, providing insights and advice for strategy improvement.

    - The capability to learn and evolve its decision-making process through the analysis of historical data, factoring in
    real-time market behaviors and user feedback.

    - An AI component that employs statistical analysis, machine learning models, and deep learning to analyze historical
    data, with a caution against overfitting and market evolution.

    - Processing of real-time market data through advanced algorithms to respond to live market changes, coupled with challenges
    related to data volatility.

    - A mechanism for user feedback incorporation, allowing personalization of the AI and adjustment of trading strategies
    and risk management rules.

    - A comprehensive integration of these elements for continuous learning and adaptation, using techniques such as online
    learning and reinforcement learning, while ensuring ethical and regulatory compliance.

    - Risk management features with AI and ML creating autonomous decisions on aspects such as stop-loss and take-profit parameters.

    - A secure user authentication system to control access to personal trading strategies and performance analytics.


    The AI and ML components will be developed to progressively enhance their decision-making capabilities while conforming
    to ethical standards and financial regulations. The system aims to balance customization, user experience, and financial
    efficacy, requiring continuous monitoring and adjustment for optimal performance.

    Here are user stories that specify how users use "ai_and_ml_":

    ```


    - User will receive trade execution with above 80% accuracy through the application''s use of neural networks and advanced
    technologies.


    - User will have the application analyze online news sources to inform trading decisions and update the AI with relevant
    information daily.


    ```



    Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

    ```


    - Node.js


    - MongoDB


    - PeeWee


    - Bootstrap


    - HTML


    - CSS3


    - Socket.io


    - TensorFlow


    - Keras


    - scikit-learn


    - pandas


    - NumPy


    - matplotlib


    - D3.js


    - axios


    - JWT


    - bcrypt


    - MetaApi SDK


    - cheerio


    - express


    ```






    We''ve broken the development of this app down to these tasks:

    ```

    1. Initialize the project structure with Node.js, set up an Express server, and create a default route.


    2. Set up secure authentication and user account management using JWT and bcrypt.


    3. Install and configure the MetaApi SDK to establish connectivity with MetaTrader platforms.


    4. Create the base AI decision-making engine structure with TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn, allowing the input of
    user-defined strategies.


    5. Implement the data processing module to fetch and prepare real-time market data for analysis.


    6. Design and implement the Graf visualization component using D3.js that dynamically displays account growth and strategy
    insights.


    7. Develop the user feedback mechanism to personalize AI strategies and risk management rules.


    8. Implement risk management algorithms to autonomously calculate stop-loss and take-profit parameters based on AI and
    ML recommendations.


    9. Incorporate real-time news analysis into the trading algorithm using cheerio and axios to parse news feeds.


    10. Finalize and integrate all components into a cohesive system with an initial testing phase on a demo trading account.


    ```


    You are currently working on task #1 with the following description:

    ```

    Initialize the project structure with Node.js, set up an Express server, and create a default route.

    ```


    After all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `When accessing the ''/ping''
    endpoint, the browser should display the text ''pong''.`


    Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands
    that need to be run to implement this task.


    **IMPORTANT**

    When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code
    in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split
    it into smaller files.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

    You do not need to make any automated tests work.


    DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative
    path to each file that needs to be written.


    Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it''s reserved.'
response: "To set up the project structure for the `ai_and_ml_` application, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Initialize\
  \ the Node.js project\nTo initialize a new Node.js project, you should run the following command in your project directory:\n\
  \n```sh\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis command creates a `package.json` file with default configurations.\n\n### Step 2: Install\
  \ dependencies\nInstall Express.js, which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust\
  \ set of features for web and mobile applications. Alongside Express.js, install the other necessary NPM packages:\n\n```sh\n\
  npm install express --save\n```\n\n### Step 3: Set up the entry point file\nCreate an entry point file for the project:\n\
  \n`./index.js`\n\nAdd the following code to initialize Express:\n\n```javascript\n// ./index.js\n\nconst express = require('express');\n\
  const app = express();\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;  // Choose a port other than 5000\n\napp.get('/ping', (req,\
  \ res) => {\n  res.send('pong');\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n\
  });\n```\n\nThis code snippet does the following:\n- Imports the Express module.\n- Initializes an Express application instance.\n\
  - Defines a route handler for the `GET /ping` request that will send back a 'pong' response.\n- Sets the app to listen on\
  \ the specified port, printing a message to the console when the server is running.\n\n### Step 4: Start the server\nTo\
  \ run the Express server, execute the following command:\n\n```sh\nnode index.js\n```\n\nBy following these instructions\
  \ and running the commands provided, you will successfully accomplish task #1\u2014setting up a basic Express server with\
  \ a `/ping` endpoint that responds with 'pong'. When a human developer accesses this endpoint through the browser, they\
  \ should see the text 'pong', which will fulfill the programmatic goal for this task."

name: ai_and_ml_
description: 'The project will encompass the development of a software application, designated as "ai_and_ml_", designed to
  interface with MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platforms via APIs, webhooks, or HTTP protocols. The application
  will perform analysis and execute trades automatically within the financial markets, supporting all trading instruments
  available on these platforms.


  Key features of "ai_and_ml_" will include:


  - A decision-making engine using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to autonomously determine when to
  execute trades.

  - Customizable user-defined trading strategies, which once written and saved in normal language, allow the application to
  trade based on specific methods like martingale, averaging, high-frequency trading (HFT), or bespoke strategies.

  - A visual graphical representation (Graf) for tracking account growth, providing insights and advice for strategy improvement.

  - The capability to learn and evolve its decision-making process through the analysis of historical data, factoring in real-time
  market behaviors and user feedback.

  - An AI component that employs statistical analysis, machine learning models, and deep learning to analyze historical data,
  with a caution against overfitting and market evolution.

  - Processing of real-time market data through advanced algorithms to respond to live market changes, coupled with challenges
  related to data volatility.

  - A mechanism for user feedback incorporation, allowing personalization of the AI and adjustment of trading strategies and
  risk management rules.

  - A comprehensive integration of these elements for continuous learning and adaptation, using techniques such as online
  learning and reinforcement learning, while ensuring ethical and regulatory compliance.

  - Risk management features with AI and ML creating autonomous decisions on aspects such as stop-loss and take-profit parameters.

  - A secure user authentication system to control access to personal trading strategies and performance analytics.


  The AI and ML components will be developed to progressively enhance their decision-making capabilities while conforming
  to ethical standards and financial regulations. The system aims to balance customization, user experience, and financial
  efficacy, requiring continuous monitoring and adjustment for optimal performance.'

development_plan:
- description: Initialize the project structure with Node.js, set up an Express server, and create a default route.
  programmatic_goal: The Express server must be running on a predefined port, with a GET endpoint at `/ping` which responds
    with a status code 200 and a plain text message 'pong'.
  user_review_goal: When accessing the '/ping' endpoint, the browser should display the text 'pong'.
- description: Set up secure authentication and user account management using JWT and bcrypt.
  programmatic_goal: Implement registration and login endpoints, integrating JWT for tokens and bcrypt for password hashing.
    Include middleware to validate authentication tokens on protected routes.
  user_review_goal: A user should be able to register and subsequently log in, with invalid attempts properly rejected.
- description: Install and configure the MetaApi SDK to establish connectivity with MetaTrader platforms.
  programmatic_goal: Create a service to authenticate with MetaApi and verify successful connection to both MT4 and MT5 platforms
    using test credentials.
  user_review_goal: Ensure the connection to MetaTrader is established and can be demonstrated via a test account's successful
    connection status.
- description: Create the base AI decision-making engine structure with TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn, allowing the
    input of user-defined strategies.
  programmatic_goal: Develop a basic ML model setup capable of ingesting user-defined parameters and historical data, and
    include a unit test confirming that the model can be trained with dummy data.
  user_review_goal: A predefined and training-capable ML model structure must be in place, evidenced by a successful training
    test run.
- description: Implement the data processing module to fetch and prepare real-time market data for analysis.
  programmatic_goal: Build a module that utilizes pandas and NumPy to acquire, parse, and format live trading data, ensuring
    that it's compatible with the ML model's input requirements.
  user_review_goal: Real-time market data should be processed and formatted appropriately, ready for use in the trading algorithm.
- description: Design and implement the Graf visualization component using D3.js that dynamically displays account growth
    and strategy insights.
  programmatic_goal: Produce a series of D3.js charts that are connected to a mock backend data source reflecting hypothetical
    account performance and strategy statistics.
  user_review_goal: Visually appealing and interactive charts should display simulated account performance metrics on the
    front-end.
- description: Develop the user feedback mechanism to personalize AI strategies and risk management rules.
  programmatic_goal: Construct an interface for user feedback input that adapts the AI model's parameters and incorporate
    a versioning system to track changes.
  user_review_goal: Users must be able to provide feedback that influence strategy decisions, with the application showing
    updated strategy parameters accordingly.
- description: Implement risk management algorithms to autonomously calculate stop-loss and take-profit parameters based on
    AI and ML recommendations.
  programmatic_goal: Code an algorithm using ML outputs to determine and set suitable stop-loss and take-profit thresholds,
    including logging capabilities for analysis.
  user_review_goal: The app should autonomously assign stop-loss and take-profit levels to trades based on AI analysis, with
    logs available for review.
- description: Incorporate real-time news analysis into the trading algorithm using cheerio and axios to parse news feeds.
  programmatic_goal: Establish a function that fetches, scores, and integrates the sentiment derived from financial news articles
    into the trading decision process.
  user_review_goal: The AI should exhibit changes in trading behavior based on the interpreted sentiment of recent financial
    news articles.
- description: Finalize and integrate all components into a cohesive system with an initial testing phase on a demo trading
    account.
  programmatic_goal: Complete the setup ensuring all components (AI/ML engine, Graf, data processing, and risk management)
    interact as required, with automated tests validating the basic workflow on a demo MetaTrader account.
  user_review_goal: The integrated system must perform analysis, execute trades, and visually represent the results on a user
    interface, all functioning correctly when assessed with a demo account.
